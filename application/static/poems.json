	"content": "Winter. Time to eat fat /n and watch hockey. In the pewter mornings, the cat, /n a black fur sausage with yellow \n Houdini eyes, jumps up on the bed and tries \n to get onto my head. It’s his \n way of telling whether or not I’m dead. \n If I’m not, he wants to be scratched; if I am \n He’ll think of something. He settles \n on my chest, breathing his breath \n of burped-up meat and musty sofas, \n purring like a washboard. Some other tomcat, \n not yet a capon, has been spraying our front door, \n declaring war. It’s all about sex and territory, \n which are what will finish us off \n in the long run. Some cat owners around here \n should snip a few testicles. If we wise \n hominids were sensible, we’d do that too, \n or eat our young, like sharks. \n But it’s love that does us in. Over and over \n again, He shoots, he scores! and famine \n crouches in the bedsheets, ambushing the pulsing \n eiderdown, and the windchill factor hits \n thirty below, and pollution pours \n out of our chimneys to keep us warm. \n February, month of despair, \n with a skewered heart in the centre. \n I think dire thoughts, and lust for French fries \n with a splash of vinegar. \n Cat, enough of your greedy whining \n and your small pink bumhole. \n Off my face! You’re the life principle, \n more or less, so get going \n on a little optimism around here. \n Get rid of death. Celebrate increase. Make it be spring. "},
